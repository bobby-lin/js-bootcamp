/*
Manipulating array
- from the end (push and pop)
- from the front (shift and unshift)
- middle of array (splice -> can delete an item or add an item at an index)

Object comparison
- If two objects are assigned in different memory, then they are not equal.
- This means if you are searching the object in the array, you need to use method such as 
1) For finding the index, use findIndex and compare the object properties.
2) For finding the item directly, use find.
